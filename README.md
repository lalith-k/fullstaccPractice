The 'main' branch is for the front end part of the application and the 'backend' branch is for the backend part of the application.
It is a simple program for practicing how to integrate front end and back end in web development. 
Front End is written in React.
Back End is written using Express JS.
The Axios http client is used to integrate the back end and front end. 

For required dependencies use:
npm i express (In the backend terminal)
npm i dotenv (In the backend terminal)
npm i axios (in the frontend terminal)

Make a main directory and inside that make 2 directories: one for frontend and one for backend
go into the front end directory git clone only the 'main' branch
go into the back end directory and git clone only the 'backend' branch
